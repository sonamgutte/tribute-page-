The full name of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam is Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. 
He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. 
He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development 
Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space 
programme and military missile development efforts. 
He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his 
work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
<br></br>
Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the 
then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",
 he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several 
 prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
<br></br>
While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent 
cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held 
in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
